          Hi! I'm <b>Luka</b>, a junior UI/UX designer based in the West Midlands and recently graduated with a BA(Hons)
          in Marketing Communications.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I love to solve problems creatively and making digital experiences that feel more human. I'm detail-oriented,
          quick to learn, and endlessly curious about exploring new tools and ideas. Nothing excites me more than seeing
          a concept come to life, whether that's an app or a website!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I designed and coded this portfolio from scratch as a space to showcase my UI/UX work and experiment with
          HTML, CSS, and open-source tools. It's a reflection of my love of learning, creating, and building things from
          the ground up!

            <h1 style="color: #ef3f4d">Overview</h1>
            <p>
              A one week design sprint to create a prototype weather app designed for a specific demographic, in my case
              for children, within Marvel.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h1 style="color: #f8b43d">Problem</h1>
            <p>
              Children want to know what the weather is, but most weather apps are complicated and information dense as
              they are designed with adults in mind. Kids need a simpler, more visual-centric user interface that is
              quick and easy to understand, keeping them engaged long enough to check before school or playtime.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="section01Img" style="flex: 0 0 30%">
            <img src="/images/frogcast/frog.png" alt="Frog character Illustration" />
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section02">
          <h1 style="color: #8faa3e">Insight</h1>
          <p>
            Through a P.A.C.T. analysis, in order to make it more suitable for my demographic, I identified the key
            points to keep in mind. Children have smaller hands and typically less motor skills so will need clear large
            buttons. They'll most likely check before heading out somewhere, typically school or playtime, so they won't
            be using it for a long period of time. They are likely to be checking with a parent around, on a larger
            device such as a touchscreen tablet.
          </p>
          <img src="images/frogcast/pactAnalysis.png" alt="PACT Analysis" />
          <p>
            Children are naturally drawn to bright colours, large buttons and friendly characters, all of which support
            learning comprehension. Research has shown that character-based engagement helps children retain information
            and stay interested.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h1 style="color: #3188db">Solution</h1>
          <img src="images/frogcast/colour.png" alt="Frogcast Colour Palette" />
          <p>The Frogcast colour palette is simple, bold and colourful in order to keep children's attention.</p>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="images/frogcast/conceptFrog.png" alt="Frog Character Concept Sketches" />
          <p>
            A few iterations of what a frog character, who would guide kids on each screen, could look like with various
            shapes and proportions. I asked people which their favourite was, and the majority was between 2 and 3, so
            the final concept combines both iterations.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="images/frogcast/conceptDaily.png" alt="Daily View Mockup Sketches" />
          <p>Some concept sketches of how today's weather could be displayed.</p>
          <img src="images/frogcast/conceptDressup.png" alt="Dress Up Mockup Sketches" />
          <p>
            I wanted to have a 'Dress Up' minigame, where kids would get to dress up the frog based on the current
            weather (e.g. in a raincoat if it was raining).
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="images/frogcast/conceptWireframe.webp" alt="Frogcast Lo-Fi Wireframe Sketches" />
          <p>
            Lo-fi wireframe sketches in order to gauge how the app will function, as well as how many screens would need
            mocking up.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section02">
          <h1 style="color: #855fdb">App Screenshots</h1>
          <img src="images/frogcast/frogcastScreens.png" alt="Frogcast Homepage Screenshots" />
          <p>
            Simple homescreen with focus on the frog character. The background and frog will change depending on the
            current weather, with a simple line reminding kids of relevant information (e.g. bringing an umbrella if its
            raining, wearing suncream if its sunny). The daily and weekly view will share their designs and have big
            icons displaying the weather for each hour/day.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <img src="images/frogcast/frogcastScreens2.png" alt="Frogcast Dress Up Minigame Screenshots" />
          <p>
            Part of the weather app would be a minigame where depending on the current real life weather, kids would get
            to dress up the frog character in relevant clothing. As well as a fun addition, it would also help teach
            young kids on what clothes to wear depending on that day's weather.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section02">
          <h1 style="color: #ef3f4d">Reflection</h1>
          <p>
            Because of the tight time constraints, I wasn't able to fully mockup what the other minigames in the game
            section would look like. If I were to continue, I would mockup some of the games as well as mockup what the
            dressup minigame & other games might look like in different weather scenarios. However, the time limit was a
            good learning experience in what to prioritise within the creation process, especially since this prototype
            unlike my other ones were done in Marvel rather than Figma, so I spent some of the time learning Marvel.
          </p>

          <p>
            Additionally, with more time, it would be great to test this app prototype with actual children to see what
            their opinions on the app would be and see how they interact with it to improve upon the base design.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, I think the app achieved its purpose through being suitable for its target audience and I learnt a
            lot about working to time constraints.

              A prototype mobile app for Falmouth Food Co-Op, a community-run online grocery store selling produce from

          <p>
            The existing Falmouth Food Co-Op website is confusing and difficult to use, which often leads to
            discouraging new users from placing orders. Many of these users want to support local farmers and share the
            Co-Ops beliefs, but strugles with the ordering system often leads to frustration and missed sales
            opportunities.

            at putting money back into the local economy, rather than big supermarkets which do not reinvest their money
            into the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            The biggest pain point he stressed was how their current userbase struggled with using the website to place
            orders, and this may deter them away from using the site again in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            He mentioned that rebuilding & redesigning the website wasn't be an option due to the cost of resources that
            had already been used to set up the website, though the Co-Op was interested in looking into producing a
            mobile app to provide a more user-friendly option for ordering.

          <h3>Empathy Map</h3>
          <img src="images/ffc/empathyMap.png" alt="FFC Empathy Map" />
          <p>
            I interviewed a first-time user to walk me through their feelings and experience while using the site to put
            into an empathy map. I found similar pain points, such as confusion during the ordering process, unclear
            navigation and frustration.

          <h2>Solution</h2>
          <h3>User Flow</h3>
          <p>
            I evaluated the current FFC ordering process on their site. I then simplified into a more intuitive,
            mobile-first flow inspired by other grocery apps to mirror how users actually shop.

          <br />
          <h3>Colour Palette</h3>
          <img src="images/ffc/colourPalette.png" alt="Colour Palette for the FFC app" />
          <p>
            I simplified down & refined their existing colour palette, which was originally a bit overwhelming. I kept
            the broad range of colours to reflect the range of the produce they sell and the people they work with.

            This was a great opportunity to work closely with a local buisness, as well as learning how to simplify an
            existing system without changing its backend. Translating their complex site into a clean, intuitive
            mobile-first UX was a valuable design challenge. After the project, I spoke with a member of the FFC who was
            really impressed, and he mentioned how the Co-Op was looking to get funding to turn it into a fully
            functional app, which was really exciting!

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <h2>We believe everyone should get to experience stargazing.</h2>
            <p></p>

            <p>
              Dark Skies is an app designed to make stargazing accessible for everyone by helping people discover safe,
              local dark sky locations.
            </p>

            <p>
              This project was developed as part of my university's 'Start Up' module. I was in a team of 5 and my role
              was UI & MVP Designer.

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <h2>Finding a good dark sky spot shouldn't be this hard</h2>
          <p>
            Many people want to experience stargazing but can't because good dark sky spots are hard to find, in far out
            observatories, or hidden in word-of-mouth insider channels. This makes stargazing feel inaccessible for
            beginners and casuals.
          </p>
        </div>
        <hr />

        <div class="section02">
          <h3>The Insight</h3>
          <h2>What draws people to stargazing? What stops them?</h2>

          <p>
            Before creating Dark Skies, we wanted to understand what makes stargazing both inspiring and difficult for
            people. Through competitor research, surveys, and a small focus group, we discovered a clear gap in local
            discovery.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h2>Competitors</h2>
          <p>We compared two most of our most similar competitors: Dark Sky International and Go Stargazing.</p>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Dark Sky International:</b> web-only, lists only officially recognised sites (21 in the UK)</li>
            <li>
              <b>Go Stargazing:</b> includes more dark sky sites, but relies on submissions by the official "Go
              Stargazing Team" and councils, meaning additions are slow.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Both lacked accessibility and immediate local coverage, showing a gap for a mobile-first, user-friendly
            option.
          </p>

          <br /><br />
          <h2>Survey</h2>
          <p>
            Our survey reached over 17 participants from across our university campus as well as online stargazing
            communities.
          </p>
          <br />
          <img
            src="images/darkSkies/survey.png"
            alt="Screenshot of Facebook stargazing group, the survey we conducted and a photo of a QR code for people to conduct our survey"
          />
          <br /><br />
          <p>
            Most respondents were casual stargazers, drawn to the awe and beauty of the night sky rather than technical
            astronomy. They often stargazed from convenient spots such as their gardens, beaches or while walking their
            dog.
          </p>
          <br />
          <img src="images/darkSkies/surveyResults.png" alt="Collage of some of the responses from the survey" />

          <p>The biggest challenges highlighted were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Light pollution</li>
            <li>Cloud coverage</li>
            <li>Uncertainty about where to find better stargazing locations</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          <h2>A/B & Hypothesis Testing</h2>
          <p>To identify which user need to prioritise, we ran small-scale A/B tests via Instagram ads.</p>
          <img src="images/darkSkies/instagramPosts.png" alt="Instagram posts" />
          <p>We wanted to compare three different needs:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><b>Social Need:</b> planning group meetups</li>
            <li><b>Discovery Need:</b> finding nearby dark sky zones</li>
            <li><b>Learning Need:</b> helping beginners to start through resources & tutorials</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            Each ad linked to a temporary landing page at darkskies.app, where users could sign up for a newsletter.
            This helped us both gauge interest and recruit participants for a later focus group.
          </p>

          <p>In total we got...</p>
          <img
            src="images/darkSkies/stats.png"
            alt="46 newsletter subscriptions, 479 Instagram ad engagements and 548 website visits"
          />

          <br /><br />
          <p>The discovery need got the most clicks, showing the most user demand.</p>

            alt="Collage consisting of screenshots of the Instagram analytics as well as the original Instagram posts we set up"
          />
          <br /><br />
          <h2>Focus Group</h2>
          <p>
            Participants said they already had friends to go stargazing with, so they didn't need social features.
            Instead, they wanted reliable, safe local spots that were easy to find. Safety, time, and convenience were
            recurring concerns.
          </p>

          <br /><br />
          <h2>User Persona</h2>
          <p>Using insights from our survey and focus group, we developed a user persona.</p>

          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <h2>Moodboard</h2>
          <img src="/images/darkSkies/moodboard.webp" alt="Moodboard" />
          <p>Capturing the general vibe of the Dark Skies brand. Simple, intuitive but unique.</p>
          <p>
            Instead of the usual purples and blues used in astronomy apps, we used red and black, inspired by red light
            filters on phones stargazers use to protect their night vision. This not only makes the app visually
            distinct but also functional with real stargazing habits.
          </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h2>User Flow</h2>
          <img src="/images/darkSkies/userflow.png" alt="User Flow" />
          Basic user flow flowchart. From the first launch, users can immediately start searching for nearby dark sky
          locations with ease.

          <h2>Wireframes</h2>
          <img src="/images/darkSkies/wireframe.png" alt="High Fidelity Wireframes" />
          <p>High fidelity wireframes built following Material Design principles for familiarity and ease of use.</p>
          <br /><br />
          <h2>Design System</h2>
          <img src="/images/darkSkies/typography.png" alt="Typography" />
          <p>
            Montserrat was used due to it's legibility and urban feel, especially as many Dark Skies users are likely to
            be living in urban areas.
          </p>
          <br />
          <img src="/images/darkSkies/colours.png" alt="Colour Palette" />
          <p>
            Dark Skies uses a mainly dark colour palette: deep blacks with a subtle blue tint (like the night sky) with
            a bold red accent for contrast.

          <p>
            It was really fulfilling to see Dark Skies grow from a basic idea into a very nearly real product,
            especially one based on real user needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project taught me the value of small, easy user tests, such as social media A/B experiments and
            surveys, especially in the beginning of a project, which led to a better overall product.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I was to revisit this project, I'd gather feedback on the current design from our newsletter sign ups
            using a service like UserTesting to further improve it to our user's needs.

          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            During my internship at <a href="https://www.flowmo.co/">Flowmoco</a>, I was given the opportunity to
            redesign KNEEguru, a long time client of theirs. KNEEguru is a site dedicated to helping people understand
            about and recover from knee injuries. It hosts educational articles, talks from knee experts and resources &
            support for patients around the world.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <img src="images/kneeGuru/oldSite.png" alt="Images of the old Kneeguru site" />
          <p>
            The existing KNEEguru site was visually dated and difficult to navigate. The structure & design of the
            content was inconsistent, making the overall experience confusing to navigate for users. As Flowmoco was
            updating the backend of the site, the site needed to be migrated from an older CMS, so the redesign had to
            keep in mind backend limitations, such as building with modular content blocks.
          </p>

          <br />

          <h2>Process</h2>

          <img src="images/kneeGuru/siteBreakdown.webp" alt="Breakdown of blocks used" />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Conducted a breakdown of the existing site to identify common content blocks and the current user flow.
            </li>
            <li>
              Redesigned each block with a new, modern visual identity focused on improved navigation and accessibility
              (keeping in mind WCAG accessibility standards)
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaborated with the Flowmoco dev team to ensure the updated design integrates smoothly with their CMS.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br />

          <p>
            The KNEEguru redesign is now live, still preserving its wealth of trusted medical information but now
            presented in a lot more user-friendly way. The updated CMS blocks should make it easier for KNEEGuru to
            update their site as well as making making room for future scalability.

          <h2>Reflections</h2>
          <p>
            Working with an existing backend and legacy content was a great learning experience. Collaboration with the
            dev team through frequent meetings made sure we were all on the same page and was an invaluable opportunity.
            Seeing my redesign live on the client's site feels really rewarding!
